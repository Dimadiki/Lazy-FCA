This dataset provides insights into the health, attendance, and overall well-being of college students. It combines biometric data (stress levels,
sleep patterns, anxiety, and mood scores) with class attendance information to assess the relationship between student health and academic performance. 
The dataset is designed for studying and analyzing factors that influence student engagement and risk levels in an educational setting.
